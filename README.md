## E-Commerce site

Users can search for products from 4 categories. They can sort and filter products by price or category, and add items to cart. The checkout includes a billing form and an order summary.

You can check out the LIVE project [**HERE**](https://e-commerce-mr.netlify.app/ 'Completed project').

### Motivation

The primary motive was to try out and learn both **Redux** and **Material-UI**. I also thought an e-commerce project would be an
interesting and educational undertaking in general. I discovered [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/ 'Fake Store API homepage') to get data for my application.

### Technologies used:

- **ReactJS**
- **Redux** for state management
- **Material-UI** for styling and components
- **React Router** for routing

---

### Challenges:

Getting accustomed to **Redux** workflow was rather intimidating at first. It was difficult to wrap my head around all the boilerplate code necessary to even begin doing something. I chose to deep-dive into the Redux official documentation to
get a better understanding, and eventually it started to make
more sense.

I had never worked with a UI framework before either and it felt
strange not having to build everything from scratch. I learned
that the best way to understand the Material-UI ecosystem better
was just to implement components in my project and try to
customize them.
